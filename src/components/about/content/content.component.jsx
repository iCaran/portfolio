				Hi, I am Shivam Bhasin, a B.Tech CSE student with a huge interest in
				technology, coding, and development. Well, it all started with an idea
				to build a School Report Management System for my school and I ended up
				learning full-stack development. Currently, I have hands-on experience
				in Web development, Video Editing, Photo Editing, and competitive
				Programming. I plan to be a Freelancer in these fields till I am
				pursuing my college and want to get a lot of skills and experience in
				the industry. I am also a fast typer and a very fast learner.
			</p>
			<p>
				My best interest is to develop new things and work in a good community
				and give back to the community using my skills. I like to teach people
				how to code because it helps me gain knowledge myself too. I am looking
				forward to contributing to Open Source too. I consider myself as a
				forever student adapting to every challenge thrown towards me and
				accomplishing it.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the moment I am managing my college studies meanwhile I am also
				preparing my skills in the freelancing industry but further on I would
				like to look into Internship opportunities so that some real-life
				experience. You can talk to me about anything at my mail below on this
				webpage.
